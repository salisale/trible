## Trilingual Bible Generator <br /><br />
**Steps:** <br />
1. Pick three languages of your choice and download the zipped files from:
https://www.wordproject.org/download/bibles/index.htm <br />
2. Modify if needs be (e.g. two column format or a bilingual book instead of three) and run the script <br />
3. The script will output 66 PDF files, one for each book <br /><br/>


The bible has of course the most consistent and well-defined numbering system and thus makes for a good material/proper propaedeutic if one wants to learn new languages contextually. <br/>
